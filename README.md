# Regula-Falsi-Method
This is a simple web-based implementation of the Regula-Falsi (False Position) Method for finding the root of a function. The user inputs a function f(x), two initial guesses x0 and x1, and a tolerance value. The script iteratively applies the Regula-Falsi formula to approximate the root, displaying the results in a table.
